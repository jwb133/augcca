Augmented complete case estimation with missing covariates

This repository contains a Stata program implementing the methodology proposed in 'Improving upon the efficiency of complete case analysis when covariates are MNAR', published in Biostatistics in 2014 by Bartlett, Carpenter, Tilling and Vansteelandt, which can be viewed here: https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxu023

To install, download the augcca.ado and augcca.sthlp files, and put these in your personal ado folder (type adopath in Stata's console to see where this is on your machine). You should instead be able to download using "net install, from()" in Stata, but I can't get this to work as of April 2023.
